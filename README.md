# Change Log

## 1.0.0
- Release

## 1.0.1
- Changed link to Github repo.
- Added a Change log.

## 1.1.0
- Fixes bug where when you store anything, you can't retrieve them.
- Prepped code for level system in next update

## 2.0.0
- Added "Strength Levels." e.g., Bench Press. You will start off in a new save with just the bar. As you do more reps, you will level up and add weights to the bar.
- Added Config files. Configs sync based on the host. At the time of writing this, there is only one config (Stronger Body).
- Stronger Body. This allows you to be able to carry heavy things at a faster speed when you have a high strength level. **This is optional and can be turned off in the configs**
