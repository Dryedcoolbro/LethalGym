### Strength Levels
With a new save, you start off with level 1. As you get stronger, your level increases including the weight on the machine.

### Stronger Body
**THIS IS OFF BY DEFAULT AND IS IN THE CONFIGS**  
Allows you to carry heavy things and move at a faster speed.  
As strength levels get higher, your movement is more efficient.

### Current Lifts:
- Bench Press
- Squat Rack

### Upcoming/Planned:
- DeadLift Platform

**!!! UPCOMING/PLANNED LIFTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO COME !!!**
